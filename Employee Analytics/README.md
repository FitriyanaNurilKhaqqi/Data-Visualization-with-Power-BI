![Dashoard Preview](Dashboard%20Image.png)

1️⃣ Project Background

This project analyzes employee attrition data to identify workforce turnover risk, demographic vulnerability, income impact, and job role sensitivity. The objective is to transform HR records into an interactive Power BI dashboard that helps management monitor attrition patterns and identify high-risk employee segments.

2️⃣ Objectives

- Measure overall attrition rate
- Identify high-risk age groups
- Analyze attrition distribution by job role
- Evaluate salary slab impact on attrition
- Assess income level relationship with turnover
- Provide HR-focused risk insights

4️⃣ Dashboard Components & Design Logic

1. KPI Cards
- Total Employees: 1480
- Total Attrition: 238
- Attrition Rate: 16.08%
- Average Income: 2973
- Designed to provide executive-level workforce overview.

2. Attrition Overview (Donut Chart)
- 16.08% employees left
- 83.92% employees retained
- Purpose: Highlight overall workforce stability level.

3. Attrition Rate by Age (Bar Chart)
- Highest attrition in 18–25 age group (35.77%)
- Gradual decline in older age groups
- Purpose: Identify demographic risk concentration.

4. Job Role vs Age Group Attrition (Matrix Table)
- Sales Representatives show highest total attrition contribution (39.29%)
- Laboratory Technicians and Human Resources also show elevated risk
- Younger age groups dominate attrition percentages
- Purpose: Detect high-risk role and age interaction.

5. Salary Slab Impact (Stacked Column Chart)
- Highest attrition occurs in salary slab up to 5k
- Attrition decreases as salary increases
- Very low attrition observed above 15k
- Purpose: Evaluate compensation influence on employee turnover.

5️⃣ Key Findings

1. Overall attrition rate stands at 16.08%, indicating moderate workforce turnover risk.
2. Employees aged 18–25 show significantly higher attrition risk (35.77%), more than double the company average.
3. Sales Representatives contribute the largest attrition proportion (39.29%), indicating role-based retention issues.
4. Employees earning below 5k represent the highest attrition concentration, suggesting compensation sensitivity.
5. Attrition probability decreases progressively with higher salary slabs, indicating income stability effect.
